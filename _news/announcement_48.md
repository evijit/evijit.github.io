I appreared on two audio pieces this week! First, in a [piece by Matt Levin on NPR Marketplace](https://www.marketplace.org/story/2025/05/19/can-ai-take-your-coding-job)! I talk about how we are getting dependent on GenAI for coding (and other tasks) and how we need better structures to use them to aid and upskill us instead of replacing us. And second, I appeared on the [Ethical Machines podcast with Reid Blackman](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/were-not-ready-for-agentic-ai/id1751550186?i=1000709391707), to talk about AI, Agency, and how we need better scalable oversight mechanisms as the technical infrastructure around us starts to account for Agents.

I was quoted in a new [Fortune Magazine article](https://fortune.com/2024/08/12/defcon-gen-ai-bug-bounty-cybersecurity-vulnerabilities/?987123) on DEF CON 2024, talking about our push towards structured harm reporting in AI. DEF CON and AI Village this year was a resounding success, and I am looking forward to having more of these conversations with practitioners, civil society and policymakers towards greater transparency!

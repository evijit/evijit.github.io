Another article with my comments about [Stargate](https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/)! New article on [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-stargate-project-moat-deepseek-2025-1) where I talk about competitive hardware moats. I reject the false premise of compute = utility.  Teams like Deepseek have made remarkable progress creatively with less resources, and this type of progress will only be more possible by openness and collaboration!

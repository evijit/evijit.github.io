I was on the [Responsible AI podcast with Alex Alben](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/responsible-ai-from-the-ai-forum/id1733357591)! Genuinely had so much fun talking about how AI could solve human drudgery but it isn't and my bafflement as to why we are not solving problems from the ground up instead of trying to solve sci-fi unknown frontier type problems. Give it a listen!

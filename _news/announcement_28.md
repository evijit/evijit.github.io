[New article on Fortune](https://fortune.com/2025/01/22/openai-stargate-ai-sam-altman-donald-trump/) with my comments about [Stargate](https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/). I talked about the importance of public AI infrastructure, the concentration of power, and the need for openness to counter that, as well as how this mad dash for AGI can actively siphon away resources from issues that can be solved with technology in the present.

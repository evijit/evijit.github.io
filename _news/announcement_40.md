We submitted [Hugging Face's response](https://huggingface.co/blog/ai-action-wh-2025) to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy's request for information on the [White House AI Action Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/02/public-comment-invited-on-artificial-intelligence-action-plan/). We took this opportunity to (re-)assert the fundamental role that open AI systems and open science play in enabling the technology to be more performant and efficient, broadly and reliably adopted, and meeting the highest standards of security.

I was excited to be involved with the AI Village DC and partners at [DEF CON 2023](https://defcon.org/) to help organize the largest-ever public [Generative AI Red Teaming challenge!](http://aivillage.org/generative\%20red\%20team/generative-red-team/). Myself, along with several other attendees and organizers were mentioned in [the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/16/technology/ai-defcon-hackers.html?unlocked_article_code=QqiwO9KZ2dVgz77qvZdn_d0wtUydJlP-OxRmVpvYSxD6eVdiBnfwRKqn1kO498M75VY8xZfH-ryaJPdxX_fK70oQSiJN8_scGieCDMEqiEbg8IC2MFaCMFR8FOY3m1D2X8mRWLKhsEOOgzEoV7trJnskK6IXwrE1ijhwGrzhGlOaMrRT4VP2SXcKMY0WthVTKhXLuYkuTOom8KYrWJgxS8ORjfNqxcnBsA8Br7mCacRlGSG2ryt1rnpiQl_i9fnN5Pso-i1XUnmAHSlWhiGW_QxSMr0cTx0UOn1jiYN4sXJRzbHK86kgKN5CGfdScuOPVh1vD5hUwSeuCBvhlPaxfJLhx1E1V6FG3q4Jp3e_mqkHisCW8wfKqWWN0co-Gy0Q4dKsZHsZeg)!

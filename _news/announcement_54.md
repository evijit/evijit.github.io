I'm back at my alma mater Northeastern University today to talk about personal anecdotes of how I have experienced AI, how those experiences fueled my research, and the kind of questions that still remain. Looking forward to it! 🤗 [Event details](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/personal-anecdotes-with-ai-tickets)

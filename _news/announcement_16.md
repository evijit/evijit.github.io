My paper: [Coordinated Flaws Disclosure for AI: Beyond Security Vulnerabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07039) with Sven Cattell and Lucie-Aim√©e Kafee was accepted at AIES 2024! We describe the current landscape of disclosure, the need for extension of model cards towards intent and scope, and propose a framework to disclose AI flaws including independent adjudication.

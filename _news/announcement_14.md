I am excited to share my first ever policy response - [Hugging Face's response to the NIST RFC on AI 600-1: Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework: Generative Artificial Intelligence Profile](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/policy-docs/resolve/main/2024_NIST_GENAI_Response.pdf)! Thanks a ton to my manager/mentor duo Irene Solaiman and Yacine Jernite for walking me through this massive effort!

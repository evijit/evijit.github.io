New paper: [Who Evaluates AI's Social Impacts? Mapping Coverage And Gaps In First And Third Party Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05613v1). This is the first major output from the Evaluating Evaluations Coalition. We analyzed 186 first-party model release documents and 183 post-release evaluation documents across 7 dimensions of social impact. We find that model developers have become less transparent about their social impact evaluation results over time. This strengthens the case for independent third-party evaluations for AI safety.

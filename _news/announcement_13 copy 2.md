I had a lot of fun speaking at the [AI Bias and Ethics panel organized by Out in Tech and MassChallenge](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7190859597044236288/). It was great to interact with the thriving queer tech community in the Boston area and highlight important issues of discrimination and social justice issues in AI and tech in general.

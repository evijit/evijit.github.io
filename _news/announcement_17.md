Excited to announce our NeurIPS 2024 Workshop, ["Evaluating Evaluations: Examining Best Practices for Measuring Broader Impacts of Generative AI" aka EvalEval 2024!](https://evaleval.github.io/). Evaluation is an important governance tool; if sufficiently grounded, defined, and motivated by the needs of affected parties. See you at NeurIPS!

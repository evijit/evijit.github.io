Very happy to see my [op-ed about AI Ethics in India on todayâ€™s Dainik Bhaskar](https://www.bhaskar.com/opinion/news/avijit-ghoshs-column-ai-full-of-bias-is-both-a-challenge-and-an-opportunity-for-india-133333195.html). It is the largest Hindi Daily newspaper in India and being able to talk about the unique challenges of AI in the Indian context to such a wide audience means a lot to me! ðŸ™‚

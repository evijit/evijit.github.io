New paper - [Protecting Human Cognition in the Age of AI](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.12447) with Anjali Singh, Karan Taneja and Klara Guan - accepted at the [Tools for Thought Workshop](https://ai-tools-for-thought.github.io/workshop/) at [CHI 2025!](https://chi2025.acm.org/) In this work, we claim that overreliance on Generative AI models disrupt traditional learning pathways and suggest best practices for better teaching, testing, and learning tools to restore these paths.

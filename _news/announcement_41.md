My first ever op-ed! [Why handing over total control to AI agents would be a huge mistake](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/03/24/1113647/why-handing-over-total-control-to-ai-agents-would-be-a-huge-mistake/), with Margaret Mitchell, Sasha Luccioni, and Giada Pistilli is out on MIT Tech Review! In it, we investigate the slow but sure ceding of power and control to increasingly autonomous AI Agents and ask - how much autonomy is too much? We contend that these systems, built on the backbone of imperfect generative AI models, have the capability to amplify their imperfections if left unmonitored.

I spoke on the NLP & Generative AI Panel at the [Harvard Business School Tech Conference](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/harvard-business-school-tech-club_hbs-generativeai-activity-7301706801954050048-PaR-), where I reflected on my work that sits at the intersection of technology, ethics and policy. We talked policy at Hugging Face, Chinese LLMs and more!

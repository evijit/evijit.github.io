We submitted [Hugging Face’s response to the United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office’s Open Consultation on Copyright and AI](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/policy-docs/resolve/main/2025_UK_Govt_Consultation_Copyright_and_Artificial_Intelligence.pdf). We continue to champion data transparency mechanisms and standardized opt-outs (and show examples from Hugging Face’s and the community’s work in this space). We contend that TDM exceptions are required for research orgs and small open source developers to do important work.

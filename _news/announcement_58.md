I had the distinct honor of speaking at a panel entitled ['AI's Effect on the Creative Industries'](https://luma.com/08vjt3v0), organized by [All Tech Is Human](https://alltechishuman.org/) and hosted by the Consulate General of Canada in New York. We looked at the intersection of Generative AI and its impact on the creative industries, and I stressed on the importance of holistic labor protections for creatives and going beyond copyright as a single tool.

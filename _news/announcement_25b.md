I was happy to contribute to a Institute for Security and Technology report on [Navigating AI Compliance via tracing failure patterns from history](https://securityandtechnology.org/virtual-library/reports/navigating-ai-compliance-part-1/), led by 
Mariami Tkeshelashvili and Tiffany Saade. The report examines past compliance failures in other industries and how we can apply the lessons learned to AI Governance.
